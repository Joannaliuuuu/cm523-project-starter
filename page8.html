								Feeling uncertain about the true significance or purpose of the bean, you choose to retain it, making your way back to your residence. The house greets you with silence and shadows, amplifying the sense of solitude. On this day, your birthday, the emptiness feels particularly poignant, stirring feelings of sadness and a lingering thought that perhaps your parents have forgotten or are indifferent to this special occasion.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, this somber mood is unexpectedly shattered when your mother appears, the warm glow of birthday candles illuminating her face as she carries a cake towards you. To your further surprise and joy, your father is there too, having taken early leave from work. His voice fills the room with the melody of the birthday song, a simple yet profound gesture of love and celebration.
							</p>
							<p>
								The evening transforms into one of warmth and togetherness, as you and your parents share in the joy of the occasion, reaffirming the bonds of family. The worries and loneliness that had clouded your thoughts give way to laughter, conversation, and the comfort of being surrounded by those who care for you deeply. It turns out to be a truly memorable and delightful birthday night.
